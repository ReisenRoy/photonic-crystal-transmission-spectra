# photonic-crystal-transmission-spectra (MATLAB)

>The theoretical description model of optical properties of one-dimensional photonic crystal is constructed by transfer-matrix method. Transmission spectra of photonic crystal based on metamaterials with metal nanoparticles and analyzed at various parameters of crystal. **This is the primary file to start coding: no metal in PhC, no defects.**

## Initial conditions
Materials: GaAs (eps1 = 11.9) Ð¸ GaN (eps2 = 5.8)

Thickness: b = b1 + b2 = 2500 nm
